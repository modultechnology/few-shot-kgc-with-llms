 Here is the comparison of my extracted relations versus the provided gold standard:

TEXT 1:
My relations: 2
Gold relations: 2  
Matched: 1
Precision: 0.5
Recall: 0.5
F1: 0.5

TEXT 2:  
My relations: 5
Gold relations: 5
Matched: 3
Precision: 0.6 
Recall: 0.6
F1: 0.6

TEXT 3:
My relations: 5 
Gold relations: 3
Matched: 1
Precision: 0.2
Recall: 0.33
F1: 0.25

TEXT 4:  
My relations: 3
Gold relations: 4
Matched: 2
Precision: 0.67
Recall: 0.5 
F1: 0.57

TEXT 5:
My relations: 3
Gold relations: 4  
Matched: 2
Precision: 0.67
Recall: 0.5
F1: 0.57

Overall F1 Score: 0.498

In summary, my extracted relations matched 50% of the gold relations for the first text, 60% for the second, 33% for the third, 50% for the fourth, and 50% for the fifth text. This results in an overall F1 score of 0.498 compared to the gold standard. The main issues were failing to extract some key relations in Texts 3-5. I can improve by focusing on capturing all the salient entity relationships expressed in the texts.
