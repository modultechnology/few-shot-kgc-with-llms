 To compute the F1 score, I will compare the relations extracted in my previous responses to the relations in the provided gold standard.

For text 1, my response had 2 relations and the gold standard had 2 relations. Of these, 1 relation matched. So the precision is 1/2 = 0.5, and the recall is 1/2 = 0.5. Therefore, the F1 score is 2 * (0.5 * 0.5) / (0.5 + 0.5) = 0.5

For text 2, my response had 4 relations and the gold standard had 5 relations. Of these, 3 relations matched. So the precision is 3/4 = 0.75, and the recall is 3/5 = 0.6. Therefore, the F1 score is 2 * (0.75 * 0.6) / (0.75 + 0.6) = 0.667

For text 3, my response had 4 relations and the gold standard had 3 relations. Of these, 2 relations matched. So the precision is 2/4 = 0.5, and the recall is 2/3 = 0.667. Therefore, the F1 score is 2 * (0.5 * 0.667) / (0.5 + 0.667) = 0.571

For text 4, my response had 3 relations and the gold standard had 4 relations. Of these, 2 relations matched. So the precision is 2/3 = 0.667, and the recall is 2/4 = 0.5. Therefore, the F1 score is 2 * (0.667 * 0.5) / (0.667 + 0.5) = 0.571

For text 5, my response had 3 relations and the gold standard had 4 relations. Of these, 2 relations matched. So the precision is 2/3 = 0.667, and the recall is 2/4 = 0.5. Therefore, the F1 score is 2 * (0.667 * 0.5) / (0.667 + 0.5) = 0.571

In summary, the F1 scores for the 5 texts are:
Text 1: 0.5
Text 2: 0.667 
Text 3: 0.571
Text 4: 0.571
Text 5: 0.571

The average F1 score over the 5 texts is (0.5 + 0.667 + 0.571 + 0.571 + 0.571) / 5 = 0.576
